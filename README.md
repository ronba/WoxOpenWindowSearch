# WoxOpenWindowSearch
This is a Wox Launcher plugin which is used to search across multiple windows and switch to the window selected.

Basically, we have too many windows, so why not search using the title?

Initial build is already working but is ugly.

## What I want to add
Searching IE/Chrome/FireFox tabs
Searching Lync Messenger (Skype for Business...) tabs


Note:
I'm a completely amateur developer with 0 to no experience in development,
Still thinking about the design for this project and more.
Feedback/participation/situations etc are more than welcome!
